# This application is using ReactJS and HTML-CSS-JS

Halfway finished _(About 83%)_, only remaining is to add SekyuPage and try/catch statements - modals (that appears if you are sure if you want to delete, having an error and many more)

Codes are a bit in a jumbled and need cleaning up to properly check. Each pages has its own **designated folder** so there is that.

**The backend is not yet integrated into the code.**
