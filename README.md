# This application is using ReactJS and HTML-CSS-JS

Halfway finished _(About 83%)_, only remaining is to add SekyuPage and try/catch statements - modals (that appears if you are sure if you want to delete, having an error and many more) 
Note: Might add the try/catch statements other error-handling statements after the API is integrated into the frontend-system.

Codes are a bit in a jumbled and need cleaning up to properly check. Each pages has its own **designated folder** so there is that.

EDIT UPDATE: SekyuPage added by @CroseaMars, API Integration is not yet commenced will start soon this week _(__preferably this Thursday till Monday, any help is greatly appreciated)_
